# covaris_protocol_builder

This project is designed to address gaps in knowledge between current Covaris DNA shearing protocols and specific consumer needs. By building an app that allows the user to automatically create shearing protocols at a wider range of applicable base pairs for their device, analyzer, and consumable type, we will enable better service for customers and provide more resources for our Solutions team.
