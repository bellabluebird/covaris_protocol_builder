# covaris_protocol_builder

This project is designed to address gaps in knowledge between current Covaris DNA shearing protocols and specific consumer needs. By building an app that allows the user to automatically create shearing protocols at a wider range of applicable base pairs for their device, analyzer, and consumable type, we will enable better service for customers and provide more resources for our Solutions team.

To run this app, you will need to download R and RStudio from this link:

From here, just click run in the top right corner of the portal in RStudio. Reach out to bpfeiffer at covaris dot com with any questions!
